      David of the Old Testament, a humble shepherd boy who became the greatest king of Israel, struggled with sin, authority, purity, and integrity. In this inspiring 4-week series, we will look at the trials, temptations, and triumphs that King David faced and how the truths found in David's life are relevant to the real-life issues students encounter every day.
