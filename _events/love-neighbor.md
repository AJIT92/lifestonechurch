At Lifestone Church, we take Jesus' command to love our neighbors seriously. Thank you to all who participated in what was amazing session of Exploring Journey of Grace this past fall. We look forward to spending one last Monday with you as we answer your questions about how to share what you believe with your LDS neighbors.
